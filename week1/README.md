# Week1
Ok so in week1 we mostly focused on setting the environments on our systems. Such as Installing Jupyter notebook and Jupyter lab, then also using Google collab. we 
are going to sometimes run the models on Google Collab servers as it is easily accessible to everyone of the gorup.
But sometimes when on the cloud server if the ram and cpu reaches its limit then we will have no choice but to run it locally using Jupyter Lab and share the updates on GitHub.
We installed matploit, Hugging Face transformers, torch(transformer backend which is installed automatically), matplotlib(To later graph the data of the results which we get), langchain (for automation, chaining of tasks, integration of external tools), and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
